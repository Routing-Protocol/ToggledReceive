ToggledReceive
==============
This application receives and displays a binary counter on the leds.

This application works with the application 'ToggledTransmit' and acts as the receiver. It receives the count fromt the transmitter and displays the binary count on the leds.

The expected result is the leds of the mote installed with this application to display a periodically toggled between even and odd binary numbers if the transmitting mote is installed with the application 'ToggledTransmitter'.
